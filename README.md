🏥 Diabetes Patient Readmission — Healthcare Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview

This healthcare analytics project evaluates inpatient diabetes encounters to uncover patterns driving hospital readmissions and resource utilization. The goal is not just reporting metrics, but identifying meaningful risk signals that support smarter operational and clinical decision-making.
The dataset includes 102,000+ hospital encounters, enabling large-scale analysis of readmission behavior across patient demographics and medical specialties.
This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow — from structured data preparation to decision-focused dashboard insights.

🧠 Analytical Approach

🗂 Data Preparation (SQL)

- Cleaned inconsistent and missing records
- Standardized specialty categories
- Filtered low-volume specialties to avoid misleading rates
- Validated KPI calculations

📐 KPI Design

- Age-based readmission rates
- Specialty risk vs encounter volume
- Length-of-stay comparison
- High-risk utilization indicators

📊 Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Dashboard design prioritized:

- Clear decision signals
- Comparative analysis
- Risk visualization
- Operational interpretation

🔍 Key Findings

👥 Age-Based Risk Patterns

- Highest readmission rates observed in young adults (20–30) and elderly patients
- Indicates behavioral vs clinical drivers requiring different interventions

🏥 Specialty Insights

- Certain specialties show disproportionately high readmission risk
- Large departments contribute most total readmissions due to patient volume

⏳ Utilization Patterns

- Length of stay alone is not a consistent predictor
- Discharge quality and follow-up planning likely play a stronger role

---

🚦 Decision Implications

➡ Targeted readmission strategies outperform generalized policies
➡ Monitoring should focus on high-risk, high-volume specialties
➡ Age-specific discharge planning improves intervention efficiency
➡ Resource prioritization should balance risk and utilization
